Some tutorials:
W3 Schools - generally my preference, includes manipulation in beginner track
SQLZoo - better intermediate content, uses deprecated JOINs
Codecademy - requires sign up, includes manipulation in beginner track
Daily Challenges - https://www.sqlprep.com/sc_dailychallenge/daily-challenge-8/ (#1-102), potential resource for prompts for advanced queries
