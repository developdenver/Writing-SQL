# Facilitator Notes

Thank you for facilitating this workshop! 

Explain how the different tracks work: 
* The lesson is designed for folks in the beginning track. Folks in the intermediate and advanced tracks do self-guided study, ask for help from a facilitator when needed, and check their work with the solutions branch.
